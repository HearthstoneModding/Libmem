# LibmemCli Consumption Guide

> Current stable release: **v1.0.0**. Official target: **Windows x64 / .NET 8**.

LibmemCli supports two established consumption paths and one experimental packaging path. For most consumers, the **GitHub Release ZIP is the recommended starting point**.

## 1. Runtime ZIP — official release consumption

Use the GitHub Release asset when the consuming project only needs built binaries.

Current v1.0.0 release:

- Release page: https://github.com/HearthstoneModding/Libmem/releases/tag/v1.0.0
- Runtime ZIP: https://github.com/HearthstoneModding/Libmem/releases/download/v1.0.0/LibmemCli-windows-x64.zip
- SHA-256 file: https://github.com/HearthstoneModding/Libmem/releases/download/v1.0.0/LibmemCli-windows-x64.zip.sha256

Official release assets:

```text
LibmemCli-windows-x64.zip
LibmemCli-windows-x64.zip.sha256
```

The runtime directory contains the managed C++/CLI assembly, XML IntelliSense documentation, native libmem runtime, Ijwhost, package metadata, and licensing notices.

Minimum runtime files:

```text
LibmemCli.dll
LibmemCli.xml
Ijwhost.dll
libmem.dll
```

The consumer should reference `LibmemCli.dll` and keep the runtime files together with the executable. Do not mix files from different LibmemCli releases or different build commits.

For a normal .NET 8 x64 application:

1. download and extract the runtime ZIP;
2. reference `LibmemCli.dll`;
3. copy `LibmemCli.dll`, `libmem.dll`, and `Ijwhost.dll` into the application output directory;
4. keep `LibmemCli.xml` beside the assembly for IDE documentation;
5. target x64 explicitly rather than AnyCPU.

This remains the **primary stable distribution model** until a package-manager path passes the same runtime acceptance level.

## 2. Git Submodule — source/build integration

Projects that want reproducible source-level integration can add this repository as a submodule and build the pinned native + C++/CLI wrapper through the repository build scripts or reusable workflow.

This is useful when the consumer wants:

- the exact pinned libmem revision;
- source-level reproducibility;
- integration into an existing build pipeline;
- direct access to wrapper source and tests.

It is more operationally complex than consuming a prebuilt package.

## 3. Local NuGet prototype — experimental

The repository contains an **unpublished** PackageReference prototype:

```text
Package ID: HearthstoneModding.LibmemCli
Status: local/CI prototype only
Publication: disabled
Target: Windows x64 / .NET 8
```

The package ID is provisional until the package layout and runtime behavior are accepted. Development packages use a commit-qualified prerelease version derived from the current repository `VERSION`, for example `1.0.0-dev.<commit>`; they do not reuse an already published stable package identity. CI stamps the package with the repository URL and exact Git commit, and the package verifier checks that provenance before the consumer test runs.

### Prototype package layout

```text
lib/net8.0/
├─ LibmemCli.dll
└─ LibmemCli.xml

runtimes/win-x64/native/
├─ libmem.dll
└─ Ijwhost.dll

buildTransitive/
└─ HearthstoneModding.LibmemCli.targets
```

The mixed-mode `LibmemCli.dll` is currently exposed from `lib/net8.0` so PackageReference can provide the compile-time reference directly.

The native runtime assets are stored under the portable RID `win-x64`.

A transitive MSBuild target:

- rejects non-x64 consumers;
- copies `libmem.dll` and `Ijwhost.dll` into build/publish output;
- keeps the package usable for normal x64 PackageReference projects without requiring consumers to manually copy the two native runtime files.

### Build the prototype locally

After building LibmemCli x64:

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platform x64
.\eng\package-nuget.ps1 -Configuration Release
```

The script reads `VERSION`, resolves the current Git commit, validates the required x64 binaries, creates the local package, and immediately runs the package layout/provenance verifier.

### Local package test

The CI prototype performs the complete flow:

```text
Build LibmemCli
    ↓
dotnet pack
    ↓
verify .nupkg layout
    ↓
restore an independent PackageReference consumer
    ↓
build/run the consumer
    ↓
publish the consumer and verify runtime files
    ↓
reject a non-x64 consumer
    ↓
ProcessSession.Open
    ↓
Allocate / Write / Read / Dispose
```

The consumer test references **only the local NuGet package**. It does not use a project reference to LibmemCli.

This proves more than package creation: it verifies that the restored package is loadable and executable on Windows x64, that publish output receives the required native runtime files, and that unsupported non-x64 consumption fails early.

## Platform/runtime rationale

Microsoft's modern .NET C++/CLI guidance documents two constraints that directly shape this package prototype:

- C++/CLI targeting modern .NET is Windows-only.
- `ijwhost.dll` must be copied from the .NET app host into the output directory for C++/CLI components.

References:

- [Migrate C++/CLI projects to .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/cpp-cli)
- [NuGet multi-targeting and architecture-specific assets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/supporting-multiple-target-frameworks)
- [.NET Runtime Identifier catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog)

The prototype therefore uses the portable `win-x64` RID for native assets and fails early outside Windows x64.

## Why NuGet is still experimental

LibmemCli is not a normal AnyCPU managed library:

- `LibmemCli.dll` is a Windows x64 C++/CLI mixed-mode assembly;
- it depends on native `libmem.dll`;
- it requires `Ijwhost.dll`;
- architecture selection matters at compile and runtime;
- the repository does not currently build a separate AnyCPU metadata/reference assembly.

NuGet's conventional architecture-specific model supports RID-specific runtime assets, but architecture-specific compile-time assembly design needs careful validation for this mixed-mode case.

For that reason, the project will not publish the package merely because `dotnet pack` succeeds.

## Acceptance criteria before NuGet publication

A future public NuGet release requires all of the following:

1. local package layout verification passes;
2. an independent x64 PackageReference consumer restores successfully;
3. the consumer builds without a project reference;
4. `LibmemCli.dll`, `libmem.dll`, and `Ijwhost.dll` reach the consumer output correctly;
5. `LibmemCli.xml` is available for IDE documentation;
6. the consumer runs real LibmemCli API calls successfully;
7. publish output also contains the native runtime dependencies;
8. non-x64 consumers fail early with a clear diagnostic;
9. package version/provenance matches the repository release;
10. package publication does not replace ZIP releases until both paths are independently reliable.

## Current recommendation

For stable consumption today:

- **default:** use the v1.0.0 GitHub Release x64 runtime ZIP for prebuilt binaries;
- use the repository/submodule/reusable workflow when source-level reproducibility or build integration is required;
- treat the NuGet package as a development prototype until the repository explicitly marks it as an official release asset.
